  <h1> Education </h1>
    <H3> St. John's University </H3>
    <li> Bachelor's in Computer Science
    <li> Expected Graduation date: May 2020
    <p> St John's University is the college that I have been attending since Fall 2016.  I am currently a senior, expected to graduate in May 2020, with a B.S. in Computer Science.  Technology is something that surrounds everyone in today's society, and I thought that by entering this field, I would be able to make an impact in new technologies.  Computer Science as a field allows students to understand a new way of thinking.  Problem Solving is a primary topic about the cirriculum that allows students to think of a different perspective to find a solution.  Computer Science as a major is constantly progressing, and I am excited to continue learning about how it progresses in the future. </p>

      <h3>CUS1166 FINAL LAB:</h3>
      <ul><p>This project involved me, as well as four other group mates to design and implement a working website. There were sprints that were needed to be met each week, and for each sprint, some kind of feature needed to be met at each time.  The name of the website we made was called <span style= "color:Blue; font-weight:bold"> Total Collab</span>   </p>

      <p> <ul> This project is the creation of this HTML page.  The requirements inolve all of the descriptions that are seen on this web page.  This web page also has properly structured HTML tags, such as div, span, ul, li, img, table, form, h1, p, and a.  There are also external links that open to a new tab, and a menu section on the top of the page to direct users to other sections of the page. </ul>   </p>
      <h2><a href="https://mmmnice.github.io/cus1172/Milestone1/CSSOMETHI(NG.html" target="_blank"><li> <span> Project 1: Milestone 2 </span></li> </a></h2>
      <p> <ul> This milestone is about the css portion of the first project.  The requirements are to simply style the profile page created in the first milestone, using CSS. There also needs to be separate files that are needed to be used for different size monitors, specifically mobile and computer screens.  If you  reviewed my profile for the first milestone, It does look relatively the same, but the requirements should be fufilled since I moved most of the stylings in the css files.
